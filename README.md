## About The Project

<div align="center">
    <img src="/SemiKart%20Hero%20Page.png" alt="Logo" width="100%" >
</div>

This project is a result of completing the Semikart Coding Assignment for the role of Front End Developer (Intern). The assignment aimed to test my skills in front-end development, and I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery to create a stylized webpage.

## Task
The main objectives of the assignment were as follows:
- Develop a responsive webpage that closely follows the provided XD prototype.
- Implement form validation to ensure all fields are mandatory and display appropriate error messages.
- Achieve pixel-perfect development by adhering to the design specifications.
- Download and utilize the specified font family.
- Log and display all form data in the console upon submission.
- Disable the GSTN field when the user selects "Student" or "Hobbyist" in the "TYPE" field.

## Key Highlights
During the development process, I focused on the following aspects:
- Teamwork: The code was written with the intention of easy maintainability and extensibility, allowing other developers to work on and enhance the project.
- Technology Choice: I made thoughtful decisions when selecting tools and technologies, ensuring they were suitable for the task at hand.
- Readability and Maintainability: The code follows best practices, including clear naming conventions and strategically placed comments to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
- Naming convention: In my project, I have adopted the kebab-case naming convention for styling, where words are separated by hyphens and all letters are lowercase. For the JavaScript logic part, I have followed the camel case convention, where words are concatenated together and each word (except the first) starts with an uppercase letter. This approach helps maintain consistency and clarity in the codebase.
- Design Accuracy: I strived to accurately implement the design specifications, paying attention to detail to achieve a pixel-perfect result.

## Deliverables
The deliverables for this project include:
- A responsive web page with three breakpoints, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.
- Source code in a zip file or a repository, which can be accessed via Google Drive.
- Optionally, the project is deployed to a platform like Netlify, allowing easy online access and review.
- A README file (this document) is provided, offering instructions on running the project locally.

I am confident that this completed assignment demonstrates my skills as a front-end developer and showcases my ability to meet project requirements while adhering to best practices.

### Installation

1. Clone the frontend repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Pankaj1947/SemiKart-Signup.git
   ```
2. Open the cloned repo in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
3. Install the "Live Server" extension for VS Code by following these steps:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Click on the "Extensions" icon on the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - In the search bar, type "Live Server" and press Enter.
   - Look for the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey.
   - Click on "Install" to install the extension.
4. Right-click on the HTML file (`index.html`) in the cloned repo's directory.
5. Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
6. The HTML website will be opened in your default browser, and any changes made to the HTML file will be automatically updated and reflected in the browser.

By following these instructions, you can open the HTML website using the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
